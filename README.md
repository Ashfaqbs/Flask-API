# Flask API

## What is Flask?

Flask is a **micro web framework** written in Python. It’s lightweight and designed for building web applications quickly with minimal overhead. Unlike larger frameworks like Django, Flask doesn't come with all the built-in tools and features, but this simplicity and flexibility give developers full control over how they structure their app. 

Flask is commonly used to build web applications, including **RESTful APIs**, allowing you to handle HTTP requests and create endpoints for various operations such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data. Its minimalistic approach makes it ideal for small to medium-sized applications, where developers want the freedom to choose their tools and libraries without unnecessary complexity.

## Why use Flask API?

- **Lightweight & Flexible**: Flask doesn’t enforce a specific project structure, allowing developers to design APIs the way they want.
- **Easy to Learn & Use**: Flask has a simple and clear syntax, making it a great choice for developers starting with web development or APIs.
- **Scalable**: Flask can handle small applications or large, complex systems when integrated with other tools.
- **Extensive Documentation & Community**: Flask has rich documentation and a large community for support.
- **Ideal for REST APIs**: Flask is commonly used for building RESTful APIs, offering support for methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

## Who is this for?

- **Beginner to Advanced Python Developers**: Flask is suitable for both newcomers to Python web development and experienced developers looking for a simple yet powerful tool for building APIs.
- **Startups & Entrepreneurs**: Flask's simplicity makes it a go-to solution for prototyping and building quick, efficient web applications.
- **Backend Developers**: If you want to focus on creating backend services (APIs) and connect them with front-end applications, Flask is a great choice.
- **Data Scientists/Engineers**: Flask can serve as an easy interface for exposing machine learning models, data pipelines, or complex algorithms via an API.

## Scenarios to use Flask API

1. **Building RESTful APIs**: 
   - Easily create APIs to interact with databases or services over HTTP.
   - Support multiple endpoints for various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

2. **Prototyping Web Services**: 
   - Quickly prototype APIs and services that can later be expanded or refactored into larger, more complex applications.

3. **Microservices Architecture**: 
   - Flask is an excellent choice for building microservices that need to communicate over HTTP, where each service is independently deployable and scalable.

4. **Machine Learning Model Deployment**: 
   - Expose machine learning models via an API, making it easy for front-end applications to consume predictions or other model outputs.

5. **Integration with Front-end**: 
   - Build a REST API that serves as the backend for a single-page web app (SPA) or mobile application.

### Important Concepts in Flask:

1. **Routing**: Flask uses routes to map URLs to functions in our  Python code.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @app.route('/')
     def home():
         return "Hello, World!"
     ```
   - The route decorator `@app.route()` tells Flask to execute the `home()` function when a user visits the URL specified (in this case, the root `'/'`).

2. **Request and Response**: Flask provides access to incoming request data (e.g., form data, query strings) through `request`, and we can control the outgoing response with `response`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from flask import request
     @app.route('/greet', methods=['POST'])
     def greet():
         name = request.form['name']
         return f"Hello, {name}!"
     ```

3. **Templates**: Flask uses Jinja2 as its templating engine, which allows we to write HTML pages and embed Python expressions inside them.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <!-- templates/hello.html -->
     <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
     ```
     ```python
     @app.route('/hello/<name>')
     def hello(name):
         return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
     ```

4. **Static Files**: Flask can serve static files (like CSS, JavaScript, images). They are usually placed in a folder named `static`.
   - Example: `http://our domain.com/static/css/style.css`

5. **Flask Extensions**: Flask doesn't have built-in features like ORM or form handling, but we can easily extend its capabilities using extensions:
   - **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: for database interaction.
   - **Flask-WTF**: for forms and CSRF protection.
   - **Flask-Login**: for user authentication.

6. **Blueprints**: Flask allows the use of Blueprints to organize routes and views into modules. This helps to split our  application into multiple files for better organization.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from flask import Blueprint
     admin_bp = Blueprint('admin', __name__)

     @admin_bp.route('/dashboard')
     def dashboard():
         return 'Admin Dashboard'

     app.register_blueprint(admin_bp, url_prefix='/admin')
     ```

### Most Used Flask Commands:

1. **Running the Flask App**:
   - `flask run`: Starts the Flask development server. By default, this runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Setting Flask Configuration**:
   - we can use `FLASK_APP` to set the entry point for the application:
     ```bash
     export FLASK_APP=app.py  # On Linux/Mac
     set FLASK_APP=app.py     # On Windows
     flask run
     ```

3. **Debug Mode**:
   - Use `FLASK_ENV=development` to enable the debug mode, which provides detailed error messages and auto-reloading.
     ```bash
     export FLASK_ENV=development
     flask run
     ```

4. **Creating Flask App**:
   - The main entry point of a Flask app is typically wrapped in this structure:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask
     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def hello():
         return "Hello, Flask!"

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

5. **Flask Shell**:
   - we can open a Python shell with the Flask app context using `flask shell`:
     ```bash
     flask shell
     ```
     This allows we to interact with our  app’s objects, like the database, models, etc.

6. **Database Migrations (with Flask-Migrate)**:
   - For handling database migrations, we can use Flask-Migrate with commands like:
     - `flask db init`: Initialize migrations.
     - `flask db migrate`: Create a migration file.
     - `flask db upgrade`: Apply migrations to the database.

7. **Testing Flask Apps**:
   - Flask supports testing our  app using Python's built-in `unittest` module, or we can use `pytest`. For example, in testing:
     ```python
     def test_home(client):
         response = client.get('/')
         assert b'Hello, World!' in response.data
     ```

8. **Flask with Forms**:
   - Handling forms is easy with `Flask-WTF` (an extension for handling forms):
     ```python
     from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
     from wtforms import StringField
     class NameForm(FlaskForm):
         name = StringField('Name')
     ```

### Flask Common Methods and Functions:

- **`render_template()`**: Renders an HTML template.
  ```python
  render_template('index.html', title='Home')
  ```

- **`url_for()`**: Generates the URL for a given view function.
  ```python
  url_for('home')
  ```

- **`redirect()`**: Redirects to another route.
  ```python
  redirect(url_for('login'))
  ```

- **`flash()`**: Temporarily stores messages to be shown to users (useful for showing success or error messages).
  ```python
  flash('we have logged in!', 'success')
  ```

- **`session`**: Stores data between requests (similar to cookies but server-side).
  ```python
  session['user_id'] = user.id
  ```

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- Flask
- Dependencies for connecting to databases (e.g., SQLAlchemy, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Create your app** (app.py):
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, jsonify

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/api', methods=['GET'])
   def hello_world():
       return jsonify(message="Hello, World!")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

3. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Test the API**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/api`. You should see the response:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Hello, World!"
   }
   ```
